La Baguette
(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

A baguette is a long, thin loaf of French bread that is commonly made from basic
lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law). It is
distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.
A baguette has a diameter of about 5 or 6 centimetres (2 or 2â…“ in) and a usual
length of about 65 centimetres (26 in), although a baguette can be up to a metre
(39 in) long. The word "baguette" was not used to refer to a type of bread until
1920, but what is now known as a baguette may have existed well before that
date. The word simply means "wand", "baton" or "stick", as in baguette magique
(magic wand), baguettes chinoises (chopsticks), or baguette de direction
(conductor's baton).
